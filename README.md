# MIT6.006Algo
Julia Implementations of Algorithms Covered in MIT 6.006

This course provides an introduction to mathematical modeling of computational problems, as well as common algorithms, algorithmic paradigms, and data structures used to efficiently solve problems on large inputs. This course also emphasizes the relationship between algorithms and programming, and introduces basic performance measures and analysis techniques for these problems.

Eg of large Systems:
- Social Networks: Facebook
- US Highway Networks
- Human Genome


Pre-requisite: 6.042: Asymptotic Complexity,
